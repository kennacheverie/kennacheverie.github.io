    <h2>Writing Remix</h2>
	<p class=tab ><i>
	For this assignment, I was challenged to remix a piece of my writing by choosing a new audience or a new platform for the piece. I chose a piece that I had written for another course this semester about my family history, turning it into a slideshow for a "slideshow night" with my friends. The slideshow appears first, followed by the original piece. My reflection on this assignment follows.

    <h3>Original</h3>
    
    <p class=tab>I’m adopted. That’s not super relevant to this story, but it does mean that I know nothing about my genetic ancestry. Growing up I simply accepted that I had no connection to my past or where I came from, which doesn’t actually bother me. The problem was, my (adopted) family lineage couldn’t be easily traced back either. Determined to connect to the past, I decided to dig into my family history anyway. The resulting story is messy, incomplete, and pretty sad. Both sides start in County Cork, Ireland.</p> 
    <p><b>Mom’s Side</b></p>
	<p class=tab>My grandfather, Joe, was born in 1930 in Kearny, Ireland. He was one of eleven children. When the children got older, they began to immigrate to New York, leaving in pairs when they turned 18. My grandmother, Mary, was already living in New York City at the time. Her mother had died during giving birth to her younger sister, and her father was out of the picture. As a result, my grandmother was placed into an orphanage in New York City, where she was raised by Catholic nuns. As to how my grandparents met, all I know is that my grandfather came into the country through Ellis Island, and the two of them met in New York. They moved to Queens, where they had two children. They left Queens and moved to Simsbury, Connecticut, where the rest of their children were born. My grandfather fought in the Korean War, which left him with some mental health issues. He certainly wasn’t a perfect man, but my grandmother waited until all her children had left for college before divorcing him. I don’t know much about him beyond that. I know his mental health got very bad, and my parents didn’t invite him to their wedding as a result. He developed Alzhiemer’s and he died when I was 11 years old. I never met him.</p>
        
    <p><b>Dad’s Side</b></p>
	<p class=tab>My great-grandmother, Julia, immigrated to the United States from County Cork, Ireland. My grandmother Judy was born in Massachusetts and her first memories were of food rationing during World War II. She had her first child at age 16, with a man I know very little about. My Dad was this first born child, and my last name, Cheverie, comes from his biological father. My grandmother had two more children with him, both girls, and then Mr. Cheverie walked out on his family when my Dad was six years old. There are only four people left in the family who bear the name Cheverie: my immediate family and I. That name is the only trace that he ever existed. My grandmother eventually got remarried to Bill Robinson, my grandfather. They had one child together, my Uncle Will. Despite the fact that Bill was their stepfather, my Dad and his siblings only ever called him their father. As far as the family history is concerned, Bill was the father of all four children, and the four of them were full siblings. Bill also served in the military, as an Army chef. He used to make the best chicken tenders in the world, and his cooking was legendary among my family. </p>

    <h3> Writing Remix Reflection</h3>
    <p class= "tab">
    	For my writing reflection, I was inspired by the “slideshow nights” that have become popular online, where each person in a group will make a silly slideshow and then present it to their group of friends. I chose to remix a piece that I had written about my family tree. The original audience for this piece is hard to explain, since I did technically write it for a class. However, I honestly think the original audience was me: I want to write down everything I know about my messy family history so that it can be remembered. As a result, the original piece has a more serious tone, which I knew would change in the course of this writing remix. My new audience would be my friends, most likely my two roommates, who have already heard stories about my family. In the context of a slideshow night, the audience is looking to laugh.
        
	<p class= "tab">In order to take this piece and make it more funny than serious, I took advantage of the goofy components of Google Slides. I added pictures of my family and used way too many animations and slide transitions. It’s a bit jarring at times, since what I’m talking about in the text does tend to be more tonally serious, but I think that’s what makes it funny. I did end up adding more text beyond the original, mostly for context and to add some more written humor. Considering some of the heavy stuff I talk about with my family’s history, I did struggle to find a balance between staying true to the original text and making it work for the new, goofy context. If I actually wanted to talk about my family at a slideshow night, I think I would need to focus more on funny stories from my family rather than my family tree itself. If the new audience had been my immediate family, I think I could have added different kinds of jokes, especially when talking about family members who have passed away. Since the new audience was my friends, I wanted to make sure that the presentation still felt respectful and wouldn’t make people uncomfortable.</p>
    
	<p class= "tab">Overall, I think this was a fun assignment and I learned a lot about remixing. Primarily, some audiences and platforms have such drastically different moods, which can make remixing across those platforms difficult.
