    <h3>Wikipedia Edits</h3>
	<p>
        <i>After learning about and editing Wikipedia, I was asked to write a reflection.The reflection is about my personal experience as an editor, along with my thoughts about whether Wikipedia needs more editors. </i>  
	</p>
    <p class="tab">
    Personally, my initial hesitancy about editing Wikipedia came from my past experiences with encyclopedias in general. I’ve always seen them as authoritative and containing information that I don’t already know. As a result, I felt like editing on Wikipedia should be done by somebody “more qualified” than me. </p>
    
    <p class="tab">However, starting with smaller edits was helpful. As an English major, I did feel qualified to fix typos, edit sentences, or add citations to existing articles. I think that fixing typos and adding citations (especially with the help of Wikipedia’s automatic citation generator) would be easy for many people, but they don’t seem like worthy tasks to internet users unless they care about the impact of Wikipedia. Generally, I think the idea of “editing Wikipedia” has to do with adding new information or new articles, which is intimidating to most people. I even struggled trying to find articles that I could add to, since I was constantly worried about whether or not my edits would follow Wikipedia guidelines. </p>
    
    <p class="tab">Simply based on the sheer volume of content on Wikipedia, I think the site would definitely benefit from new editors. I think tasks such as basic copyediting and translating existing articles would be approachable to people while also helping Wikipedia be more accessible to the general public. College students seem to make good editors, since we have experience with the processes of editing and citing sources. In another course this semester, we are going to be creating Wikipedia pages for three transgender individuals from Boston who were murdered. I think English courses, languages courses, and even STEM courses could create assignments about editing Wikipedia, which would help Wikipedia while also teaching students digital writing skills.</p>
    
    <p class="tab">Overall, I enjoyed learning about how Wikipedia works, since it’s something I use often in my everyday life. Now that I feel comfortable editing Wikipedia, I plan on continuing to help edit, whether it be copyediting or looking for sources for non-cited information. </p>
