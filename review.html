    <h3>Review of a Digital Tool</h3>
	<p>
        <i>This is my review of Zotero, a free citation manager.</i>
	</p>
    <p class="tab">
    Zotero is a citation management tool that is free to download. It was created by <a href="https://digitalscholar.org/">Digital Scholar</a>, a non-profit organization led by history and digital humanities professors from various universities. Zotero is also open source software, meaning the code for the app is available publicly on Github, so users can view the code and contribute ideas to the development process. 
    </p>
    <p class="tab">
     The criteria for this review is based on how Zotero may be a helpful writing tool for undergraduate students who are unfamiliar with citation managers. The primary criteria will be how easy the software is to use, including how the aesthetics of the app contribute to learning how to use it. Other important criteria include cost, integration with other frequently used writing tools, and organizational features. Although Zotero does have an online citation generator, Zoterobib, this review will specifically focus on the downloadable desktop software.    
    </p>
    <p class="tab">
    The learning curve for the Zotero desktop software is steep if you are not familiar with citation management software. The desktop app does not come with a built-in tutorial, so users must navigate Zotero’s website to find information on how to use the software. For many undergraduate students who grew up with technology, the expectation is that software will be easy to understand right off the bat. Having to look up a tutorial for something can be frustrating, especially when a tool like a citation manager is advertised as making the citation process easier. 
    </p>
    <p class="tab">
    Part of this issue lies in the aesthetic design of the app: the out-of-date UI, combined with the minimal amount of buttons along the top bar of the app, confuses users on how they can begin to add citations. When I first opened Zotero, I felt like I was looking at something on an early 2010 Macbook. Many users who are unfamiliar with citation managers will gravitate towards the “New Item” button, marked by a bright green circle with a white plus sign on it. However, this button prompts users to manually input information about the source they are citing. For students who are familiar with automatic citation generators, this is frustrating and time consuming. Although the app does have a function that allows users to generate citations from identifiers ISBNs, DOIs, etc., it is not given any emphasis compared to the other functions of Zotero. For career academics who are familiar with the citation process and citation managers, Zotero may be easier to navigate upon first use. However, for undergraduate students who are familiar with citation generators such as EasyBib, Zotero can be discouraging. 
    </p>
    <p class="tab">
    The organization system within Zotero, along with the sheer volume of information that can be included in a single citation, also contributes to the difficulty of learning how to use the app. I originally downloaded Zotero so that I could download citations from academic journal sites, which come in the form of a .ris file. After downloading my first “.ris” file and opening it with Zotero, I was overwhelmed by the amount of information that was included in the citation file. There are 27 categories of information that can be filled for a single source, ranging from title to the archive the source is located in. As someone who is not familiar with every element that can be used in an academic citation, I felt a bit lost. Without a tutorial on how Zotero can create citations from this stored information, I was worried I would still have to manually organize all the information into a citation myself. In order to copy the in-text citation or bibliography citation for a source, users need to navigate to the “Edit” button on their computer’s taskbar, but most users would search for this function within the Zotero software first. 
    </p>
    <p class="tab">
    Zotero users can organize sources into Libraries or Collections. In this case, the UI of Zotero is intuitive, making it clear that Libraries are larger repositories that house Collections. However, organization beyond that point is up to the user. I was confused as to how this organizational system would align with my projects. Should I create a Library for every class I have, and then a Collection for each paper? Should each paper itself have a Library, with sources organized in Collections that describe how they are being used in the paper, or which element of an argument they are supporting? To further complicate this issue, when I was opening .ris files into Zotero, these sources were automatically being created into new Collections, meaning a single source would become its own folder
    </p>
    <p class="tab">
    However, if or when a user can overcome this steep learning curve, the features of Zotero become very useful. Add-ons for Zotero can be installed into Microsoft Word and Google Drive, allowing users to search their Zotero library for a source and insert a citation for it into their document. Zotero can also be added as an extension to Google Chrome, so users can instantly import the information from websites into Zotero. Users may choose which Library/Collection they want the information to be added to within the extension, saving the hassle of having to manually organize new citations. Other minor functions, such as being able to tag or create notes about sources can help with organization for longer-term or source-heavy writing projects. Once you get past the initial struggle, Zotero is easy to use, allowing users to organize and manage citations without any distractions. 
    </p>
    <p class="tab">
    Overall, I think Zotero is a useful writing tool. It’s free to use, which makes it a great option for students, and it’s created by people who have experience with using citations in academic writing. If the function of a writing tool is more important to you than the aesthetics of that tool, I would recommend Zotero as a citation manager. Since users don’t do any writing within the app itself, a design that’s not aesthetically pleasing won’t be disrupting any creative processes. However, the design on the Zotero app definitely contributes to its learning curve, which for many students, may be impractical to work through.
