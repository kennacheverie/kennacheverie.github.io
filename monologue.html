    <h3> “I’m the Green Monster, and I’m Sick of Youse”: An AI-Inspired Short Imagined Monologue</h3>

	<p>
        <i>This is my short imagined monologue, inspired by McSweeny's Internet Tendency! This assignment was completed with the help of AI Natural Language Generators (NLG) such as ChatGPT. The final product is below, followed by my reflection on using AI for this assignment.</i> 
	</p>
    <p class="drama">Normally, I try to be nice. I’m the icon of Fenway Park, home to the best seats in the house, and I’m the metric for a good home run. But I’m still a Bostonian. After 110 years, I think I have a right to complain. </p>
    <!-- figure out how to add more space between these paragraphs for affect --> 
    <p class="drama">First of all, I'm used to being hit by baseballs. It comes with the territory of being a left-field wall. But after years of being pelted with balls, I'm starting to get a little fed up. Can't these guys aim a little higher? I stood here for 86 years while the Sox were cursed, getting pelted with balls with nothing to show for it. Did you ever consider that my curse was being bombarded by left-field hits? I didn’t even throw a fit about the stupid Jordan’s Furniture ads that literally made me a target. </p>
    
    <p class="drama">When a ball hits the Pesky Pole, it’s a whole big thing. Aim towards first base more often. Or better yet, just hit the ball over me, since that’s what they friggin pay you to do. I’ve been watching this game for over a century, and I’m telling you that it cannot possibly be that difficult. Do you know how much it sucks to get hit with a ball going 90 miles per hour, and then everybody starts cheering? Why is my pain something to celebrate? The mascot, the one you call the “Green Monster”, I bet if he got hit with a baseball you wouldn’t be cheering. But when I get hit a million times, nobody gives a shit. </p>
    
    <p class="drama">Don’t even get me started on the goddamn beer. I get it, the whole city has an alcohol problem or whatever, but this is ridiculous. Could you at least stop spilling it on me all the time? Can you imagine standing in the same spot for game after game, season after season, getting beer dumped on you all the time? It friggin sucks. It smells like piss and it gets in the wood. And it’s always a Bud Light or a Coors or something. If you’re gonna spill beer on me, can you make sure it’s a good one? I could just be a wall without any seats on top, but no, I had to become the dumping ground for a bunch of beer and peanut shells. Sure, the games last like 4 hours and they’re boring as hell most of the time, but that’s no excuse to drink 4 beers before the 7th inning stretch. I’d love, just once, if I didn’t have to hear people try to sing “Sweet Caroline” when they can barely put a sentence together. You’re embarrassing yourselves. </p>
    
    <p class="drama">Listen, I’m not saying I’m going to quit my job and start rooting for the Stankees or something. But I have to hear you all whine about how you miss Big Papi and our pitching sucks, so now it’s my turn to complain. I don’t even get to watch the other Boston sports! All I get to do is have my ears blasted out by whatever musician-that-peaked-in-the-70s happens to be playing a concert here. Or watch a bunch of snooty college students throw their hats up in the air to celebrate being $250,000 in debt. Or get my picture taken by a bunch of tourists. I’m just saying, maybe have consideration for me, a wall that’s literally older than sliced bread. </p>
    
    <h3>AI Writing Reflection</h3>
    <p class="tab">For my Short Imagined Monologue, I decided that using an AI as a “co writer” would be an interesting experience. Reflecting on it now, I don’t think I would consider the AI as a co writer, but more as an inspiration. I was particularly interested in how realistic the humor created by an AI could be, especially because I chose a regional topic. As a result of paywalls I ended up using multiple AI generators, but I think that worked out in my favor. Most of these generators allowed me to choose the style and tone that I wanted the generated text to have, which I thought was interesting. Through trial and error, I developed a few central prompts that I gave to each AI, slightly tweaking the wording if I did not get the results I was looking for. I made a blank word document and organized the generated text based on what AI generator it came from, as well as the prompt that I had given. </p>
    
    <p class="tab">Since I was trying to create a monologue from the perspective of Fenway Park’s Green Monster, the text that was generated was generally unhelpful. For the most part, I was able to use the snippets as inspiration, seeing what I liked along with what I didn’t like. If I had been writing a more fact-based essay, I think I may have used more of the generated text directly. Personally, I think that AI generated text has its own pattern stylistically. After inputting similar prompts into multiple different generators, many of the same ideas and tones kept coming up. In my case, many of the generated blurbs took on a public service announcement tone, ending with a positive note on ‘keeping the Green Monster strong for the next 100 years!’. </p>
    
    <p class="tab">I think that AI text generators may have potential to be used as inspiration for students, since reading an AI’s attempt to say something can help clarify how you actually think it should be written. As they develop, I think it would be helpful if they could pick up on grammatical errors in terms of sentence structure, like a more complex version of Grammarly. However, I don’t think AI generators have the potential to generate the substantial analysis that I’m used to doing in academic writing. </p>
